# FSM-MiniALU
Contains Code for FSM and MiniALU projects. Written in Verilog.
I wrote these for my Digital Systems Design Module in Semester 5 at TCD.
the .v files in 'new' are the original files written by me and the 'imported' are either the files given to us for lab or files created by me for previous labs.
